Using `sqlite3`, connect to the given `northwind_small.sqlite3` database.
Answer the following questions (each is from a single table) and then
save each query under the following variable name:

- `expensive_items`: What are the ten most expensive items (per unit price) in
    the database? Please return all columns in the table, not just the price
    and name but all columns.
- `avg_hire_age`: What is the average age of an employee at the time of their
    hiring? (Hint: a lot of arithmetic works with dates.)
- (*Stretch*) `avg_age_by_city`: How does the average age
    of employee at hire vary by city?
