## Module 3 Project - NoSQL and Document-Oriented Databases
NoSQL is a method we use to interact with a non-relational database. We learned how we can use SQL to interact with a relational database and now we see its counterpart today.


## Learning Objectives
* Identify appropriate use cases for document-oriented databases
* Deploy and use a simple MongoDB instance

## Before Lecture
Sign up for an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), the official hosted service of MongoDB with a generous (500mb) free tier. You can also explore the many [MongoDB tools](http://mongodb-tools.com/) out there, though none in particular are recommended or required for installation (we're really just checking out MongoDB as a way to understand document-oriented databases. It's unlikely to become a core part of your toolkit the way SQLite and PostgreSQL may).


## Live Lecture Task
Another database, same data? Let's try to store the RPG data in our MongoDB instance, and learn about the advantages and disadvantages of the NoSQL paradigm in the process. We will depend on [PyMongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) to connect to the database.

Note - the [JSON](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Django-RPG/blob/master/testdata.json) representation of the data is likely to be particularly useful for this purpose.


## Assignment

Reproduce the live lecture task of setting up and
inserting the RPG data (specifically the `charactercreator_character`,
`charactercreator_character_inventory`, `armory_item`, and `armory_weapon`) into
a MongoDB instance. Your documents in MongoDB should contain the character traits
(name, lvel, etc.) and skills (strength, wisdom, etc.) and a list of their items.
You should also store the weapons as a list in another key value pair (you will have
duplicate items in both items and weapons) - see the example below.

Mongo document example:
```
mongo_document = {
  "name": <VALUE>,
  "level": <VALUE>,
  "exp": <VALUE>,
  "hp": <VALUE>,
  "strength": <VALUE>,
  "intelligence": <VALUE>,
  "dexterity": <VALUE>,
  "wisdom": <VALUE>,
  "items": [
    <ITEM NAME>,
    <ITEM NAME>
  ],
  "weapons" [
    <ITEM NAME>,
    <ITEM NAME>
  ]
}
```

Then answer the following question in your `README.md` file:
* How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL?
* What was easier, and what was harder?
  MongoDB is quite nice in the sense that the things are immediately related and doesn't require joining tables to find what connects to what. It also makes a bit more sense in terms of say increasing item sizes to me versus looking at a whole list of characters with x items like in SQL.
## Answers
  Accessing data is much easier in my opinion in mongodb and the formatting is much nicer as I come from a JS background. For a game I'd also imagine a nonsql approach would be better than an sql approach and that certainly feels the case when I look at the structure of MongoDb vs SQL. That's just my two cents though!
Please turn in the MongoDB python file you used to generate the documents as well as your `README.md`. It is suggested to then revisit the first two modules, rework/complete things as needed, and review the content with
fresh eyes the SQL approach. Compare and contrast, and come prepared to claass with questions  - the main topic will will discuss will be database differences and tradeoffs!

## Resources and Stretch Goals

Try to insert all the SQLite RPG data tables into your MongoDB cluster.

Put the Titanic data in Big Data! That is, try to load `titanic.csv` from yesterday
into your MongoDB cluster.

Push MongoDB - it is flexible and can support fast iteration. Design your own
database to save some key/value pairs for an application you'd like to work on
or data you'd like to analyze, and build it out as much as you can!
